  SIGHT OF YOU

##When I look deep into your eyes

It is very clear

That they are very dear

I find them very familiar

I feel a mere peace

In my eyes

We never talked straight

We never texted right

**It’s just that sight**

**Of u**

We don’t even have a picture na,

you aren’t my friend na

It’s just that sight

Of u u u

Inspire me, cheer me

##But then I realise

Those are my own eyes

When I made a bold choice and

When I will be living in my goal

But then I realise

When I dive into memories

**It was me**

Cheering in pain

**It will be me**

Embracing the moments of today’s pain

Thank you past me and future me

For taking **a while**

To remind me

That I am not sinking in the **river Nile**

Thank you past me and future me

For making me learn

Not to worry and merry

It’s just that sight

Of u u **u**

Spirits me up, strives me up

That I can **do well**

And don’t **fall in well**

It’s just that sight

Of u u **u**

Guide me, convey me

That I should **go go go**

With the **flow flow flow**

## When something is not going in the way you think then take a moment and read my writing

## ALL the BeST
